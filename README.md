# Pi-in-the-Sky
"Mortar" launch

## Assignment Description

We want to fire a projectile out of Mr. Miller's air cannon that can withold up to 100 psi of pressure. We want our payload to achieve the greatest possible velocity upon launch.

# Planning

## Initial Research
Wile researching we've learned to make sure that the center of pressure of our "mortar" needs to be behind the center of mass.

We will find the equation for velocity over time V(T) and plot it on a Velocity/Time graph. Then we will use both derivative tests to find the maximum/minimum points as well as points of concavity. 


## Initial Brainstorming
We've decided to use the teardrop shape for the main body as it is the most aerodynamic. Also, we are going to add fins to stabilize so it doesnt flip and tumble in the air.



## Initial Designing

## Air cannon

Middle opening in the larger pvc pipe is 3.042 inches, smaller pvc pipe is 2.047 inches. 

## Risk Mitigation

We will wear proper PPE during all test and final launches as well as keep the projectile safe betweeen launches. Before firing at 100 psi we will do test launches starting from as low as 20 psi. We will also do our best to not fire at homes.

# Timeline (10 weeks)

## First 2 weeks

Onshape design + CFD 

## Next 3 weeks

Learning + Creating ciruit board

## Next 2 weeks 

Coding/Testing

## Last 3 weeks 

Trials/Tribulations

# Launch day

## Rest of time

Collect data, rework designs with onshape and physical creations, launch again
