"Mortar" launch

## Assignment Description

We want to fire a projectile out of Mr. Miller's air cannon that can withold up to 100 psi of pressure. We want our payload to achieve the greatest possible velocity upon launch.

# Planning

## Initial Research
Wile researching we've learned to make sure that the center of pressure of our "mortar" needs to be behind the center of mass.


## Initial Brainstorming
We've decided to use the teardrop shape for the main body as it is the most aerodynamic. Also, we are going to add fins to stabilize so it doesnt flip and tumble in the air.


## Initial Designing
